## Hi there, I‚Äôm Manisha!
I‚Äôm a passionate Data Engineering and Data Science trainer on a mission to simplify complex tech concepts and make them click for learners across all backgrounds. From SQL queries to deploying full-blown ML models, I guide aspiring data professionals to not just learn, but live data.

## üî≠ Currently Working On:
Helping learners build end-to-end projects using Azure, PySpark, and Streamlit, and creating real-world scenarios using public datasets. I‚Äôm also working on multiple projects, and helping students ace their interviews with practical, project-based learning.
